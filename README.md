Because the fetch requests for Spotify were built inside functions, the browser wasn't waiting for a response from the API request before continuing to execute the code. To fix this, https://rapidapi.com/guides/fetch-api-async-await was referenced to turn these functions into "async" functions so that the browser would wait for a response before continuing.
