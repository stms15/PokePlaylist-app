Because the fetch requests for Spotify were built inside functions, the browser wasn't waiting for a response from the API request before continuing to execute the code. To fix this, https://rapidapi.com/guides/fetch-api-async-await was referenced to turn these functions into "async" functions so that the browser would wait for a response before continuing.

Font package was obtained here: https://www.dafont.com/pokemon.font. The site <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-include-a-font-ttf-using-css/">How to Include a Font ttf Using CSS</a> provided helpful tips on how to properly use and incorporiate the font files.
